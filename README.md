# RSNA Workshop: MONAI on AWS SageMaker

Welcome to the **MONAI on AWS SageMaker** workshop at RSNA 2023!  In this workshop, you will learn how to use [MONAI](https://monai.io/), the Medical Open Network for Artificial Intelligence, on AWS.  You will have your own temporary AWS account, and we will be working through two MONAI workshops hosted on Jupyter notebooks on AWS SageMaker, the fully managed service to prepare data and build, train, and deploy machine learning models.
